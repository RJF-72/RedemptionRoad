## 📤 Publish to GitHub & GitHub Pages (Windows)

This project is static front-end with an optional Python backend. You can host the frontend on GitHub Pages and the backend separately (e.g., a small VM or your local machine during development).

### 1) Push to GitHub

Prerequisites: Install Git for Windows and create a GitHub account.

1. Create a new empty repository on GitHub (do not add any files).
2. In this project folder, initialize Git and push:

```cmd
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit"
git branch -M main
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<your-repo>.git
git push -u origin main
```

### 2) Enable GitHub Pages

Option A — Deploy from branch (simple, no build):
- GitHub → Your repo → Settings → Pages
- Source: Deploy from a branch
- Branch: main, Folder: / (root)
- Save. After a minute, your site will be live at: https://<your-username>.github.io/<your-repo>/

Option B — GitHub Actions (optional CI):
- Add a workflow to build or copy files to `./public` then deploy. Minimal example:

```yaml
name: Deploy static site
on:
	push:
		branches: ["main"]
permissions:
	contents: read
	pages: write
	id-token: write
concurrency:
	group: "pages"
	cancel-in-progress: true
jobs:
	deploy:
		environment:
			name: github-pages
			url: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}
		runs-on: ubuntu-latest
		steps:
			- uses: actions/checkout@v4
			- name: Setup Pages
				uses: actions/configure-pages@v5
			- name: Upload artifact
				uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
				with:
					path: .
			- name: Deploy to GitHub Pages
				id: deployment
				uses: actions/deploy-pages@v4
```

### 3) Custom Domain (redemptionrd.shop)

To serve Pages at your domain:
- GitHub → Repo → Settings → Pages → Custom domain: `redemptionrd.shop`
- Commit a `CNAME` file at the repo root containing exactly: `redemptionrd.shop`
- In your DNS provider, create a CNAME from `www` → `<your-username>.github.io` and optionally an ALIAS/ANAME or A record for apex `@` to GitHub Pages IPs. GitHub docs list the recommended records.

Note: If you want the site at `www.redemptionrd.shop`, set the custom domain to `www.redemptionrd.shop` and configure a redirect from apex.

### 4) Backend deployment

- The backend is a FastAPI server under `backend/`. It runs locally with Python and can be deployed to any VM or PaaS. See `backend/README.md`.
- Frontend generators accept a `BACKEND_URL` override via query string/env script injection; when hosting, point them to your backend (e.g., `https://api.redemptionrd.shop`).

### 5) Local testing and CPU-only

- See `TESTING.md` for CPU-only backend settings and the synth/DAW self-test panel.
